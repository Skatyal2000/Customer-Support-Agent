Initiating a Return
To initiate a return on an item that's eligible for return, simply go to Your Orders and click on "Return Items" button next to the item. Detail instructions can be found in this video.

Sending Us Your Return
You can return most items for free at over 8,000 convenient locations, typically within a 5-mile radius of your address. Additionally, most returns do not need to be boxed or labeled. However, please make sure that your item is returned in original or unused condition with tags attached and hygiene seals and liners intact, and in the original manufacturer's packaging including tags, components, accessories, manuals, certificates of authenticity, and other inserts.

Please follow the return instructions for each item to receive a refund. Do not include items from separate orders in the same return.

If you have bought an item (for example, computers, electronics) on which you've saved personal information, please erase this information completely by following manufacturer instructions.

Global Store Returns
Items shipped from Amazon.com, including Amazon Resale, can be returned within 30 days of delivery, with some exceptions:

For most Amazon Global Store returns, you will be provided with a pre-paid UPS return label which allows you to return the item(s) to any UPS drop-off point located across the US. You can find your most convenient UPS location using the following link: https://www.ups.com/dropoff/?loc=en_US
Not all Global Store products are eligible for a prepaid return. In this case, you will need to return the item at your own expense. We recommend you return the item(s) using a trackable method at the carrier of your choice.
It can take up to 25 days for an item to reach us once you return it. Once the item is received and processed at our fulfillment center, it takes two business days for the refund to be processed and 3-5 business days for the refund amount to show up in your account.
Amazon will automatically refund up to $20 for return postage costs on receipt of the item. If your return postage costs exceed $20, you may contact Customer Service to request a refund of the remaining postage cost. If you return a defective, damaged or incorrect item, you'll be refunded the full postage cost, as well as your Import Fees Deposit, once your return is processed.
