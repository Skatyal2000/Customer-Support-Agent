A refund will be provided if Amazon (or the third-party seller) has received the item, and determined that you are eligible for a refund. It can take up to 30 days for us to receive and process your return. In certain circumstances refund timeframes may be longer. If we need additional information about your return, we will notify you with instructions to contact Customer Service. For more information, please see our Refunds page.

When you return an item, your Amazon refund amount and refund method may vary. Your refund and how your refund is issued may differ based on the condition of the item, how long you've had the item, and how the item was purchased.

Refund types
You can use the Online Returns Center to return most items within 30 days of delivery for a refund. We’ll offer a replacement or exchange order instead of a refund for selected items. For more information on exchanges, go to Exchange an item.

Types of refunds are:

Advanced: We issue advanced refunds when a carrier first scans your return, rather than when we receive and process it.
Declined: If we can't use your original payment method (like an expired card), refunds go to your Amazon account balance.
Partial: We reduce refunds for returns that are used, damaged, or missing parts. Find more details under Partial refunds.
Gift: Once we’ve processed a gift return, we’ll issue a refund to the person who returned the gift. Go to Return a Gift for more information.
